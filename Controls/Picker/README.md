# Picker

## ForEach

This example uses a `ForEach` to view within a `Picker`. Nice thing about `ForEach` is it isn't hit that 10-view limit that we would of hit had we typed this by hand
 
```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
  let students = ["Harry", "Hermione", "Ron"]
  @State private var selectedStudent = 0

  var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Picker("Select your student", selection: $selectedStudent) {
                ForEach(0..<students.count) {
                    Text(self.students[$0])
                }
            }
            Text("You chose: Student # \(student[selectedStudent])")
        }
      }
    }

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
  static var previews: some View {
    ContentView()
  }
}
```

Form with 100 rows
```swift
Form {
    ForEach(0..< 100) { number in 
        Text("Row \(number)")
    }
}
```

Or shorthand in a closure like this.
```swift
Form {
    ForEach(0 ..< 100) {
        Text("Row \($0)")
    }
}
```

## Picker inside a form
If you create a picker outside a form you get the spinning wheel. Inside a form however, you get the master details view.
```swift
Form {
    Section {
        TextField("Amount", text: $checkAmount)
            .keyboardType(.decimalPad)
        Picker("Number of people", selection: $numberOfPeople) {
            ForEach(2 ..< 100) {
                Text("\($0) people")
            }
        }
    }
    Section {
        Text("$\(checkAmount)")
    }
}
```
The reason for this, is that in a form, we don't want to take up too much space. Hense the one-liner.

Reason why piker starts with 4 is  because initial value was 2, and we started our loop at 2. So the second selection is actually bound to 4.

## Adding a NavigationBar
To make our picker selectable, we need to embed the form in a NavigationBar

```swift
NavigationView {
    Form {
        Section {
            TextField("Amount, text: $checkAmount")
                .keyboardType(.decimalPad)
            Picker("Number of people", selection: $numberOfPeople) {
                ForEach(2 ..< 100) {
                    Text("\($0) people")
                }
            }
        }
        Section {
            Text("$\(checkAmount)")
        }
    }.navigationBarTitle("WeSplit")
}
```
This will give us the dteail view along with it's selected value. This is a good example of declerative programming. We say what we want to happend and the framework takes care of it for us. We don't worrky about how, which weould be imperative programming.

## Binding to high-level object
Because the picker select is bound to an index, you need to bind that selection to your top level object.
```swift
import SwiftUI

struct Player {
    let name: String
    var team1Index: Int
}

class Pool: ObservableObject {
    @Published var player1: Player = Player(name: "Jonathan", team1Index: 0)
    init() {}
    
    struct ContentView: View {
        @EnvironmentObject var pool: Pool
        @State private var selectedTeamIndex = 0

        var teams = ["Edmonton Oilers", "Calgary Flames"]

        var body: some View {
            NavigationView {
                Form {
                    Section {
                        Picker("Select team1", selection: $pool.player1.team1Index) {
                            ForEach(0..<teams.count) {
                                Text(teams[$0])
                            }
                        }
                        Text("You selected: \(teams[selectedTeamIndex])")
                        Text("Bound to pool: \(pool.player1.team1Index)")
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View [
        let pool = Pool()
        ContentView()
            .environmentObject(pool)
    ]
}

```

## Segmented control

Special kind of picker showing a handful of options in a horizontal list. Great for when you have only a small selection to choose from.

```swift
Section {
    Picker("Tip percentage", selection: $tipPercentage) {
        ForEach(0 ..< tipPercentage.count) {
            Text("\(self.tipPercentage[$0]%)")
        }
    }.pickerStyle(SegmentedPickerStyle())
}
```
